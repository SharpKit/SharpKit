##### Building
An installer is available here: https://github.com/SharpKit/SharpKit/releases, to build from source code follow this:

###### Windows
```
git clone https://github.com/SharpKit/SharpKit.git
cd SharpKit
configure
make
```

This will build a debug version, to build a release version, please use:
```
make release
```

###### Linux
```
git clone https://github.com/SharpKit/SharpKit.git
cd SharpKit
chmod +x configure
./configure
make
```

###### Creating the installer (without publishing a new version)
Verify the VERSION-file in the root directory . Change the Version number if needed. Than:
```
configure # When you called this already, you do not need to call it again.
cd contrib/installer/
create
```
The installer will be created in the contrib directory and can be used for windows and linux. Note: If you create the installer on linux, it cannot be used for windows (because some windows-only libaries are missing). You should generate it on windows for better compatibility.

##### Changes from previous versions
[Path-changes](../../wiki/Path-changes) wiki page contains changes made to the file system installation of SharpKit from previous versions.
